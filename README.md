# Shuffletify

[Website](https://alejoseed.github.io/Shuffletify/)

Creates a random playlist based on a previously created list of songs 

## Why should I use it:

Usually the Spotify shuffle button tends to not be as consistent and repeat many songs from the same artist, I decided to use the Fisher-Yates algorithm to
efficiently organize the playlist in a more consistently aleatory way

### What technologies were used:

I used plain CSS and HTML, as well as Node.js to explore the possibilities of a more simplistic project
